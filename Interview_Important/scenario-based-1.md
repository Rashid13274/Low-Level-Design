# Your Interview Questions - Let me help you prepare!

## **Addressing Your Two Questions:**

### 1. **Application Access - Only Friends Can Use It**

**Possible approaches:**

- **Authentication + Authorization**: Implement a login system where you manually whitelist friend emails/usernames
- **Invite-only system**: Generate unique invitation codes/links that only your friends receive
- **OAuth with approved list**: Use social login (Google/GitHub) and maintain a database table of allowed email addresses
- **IP whitelisting**: Restrict access based on IP addresses (less practical for friends)
- **Private deployment**: Host on a private network or use VPN access

**Best answer approach**: "I'd implement authentication with a whitelist. Users log in with email/password or OAuth, and I maintain a `allowed_users` table in the database. On login, I check if their email exists in this table before granting access."

### 2. **Uploading Millions of Excel Records to Database**

**Key considerations:**

- **Batch processing**: Don't load all rows at once - process in chunks (e.g., 1000 rows at a time)
- **Async/Background jobs**: Use queues (RabbitMQ, Redis, Celery) to handle uploads asynchronously
- **Bulk insert operations**: Use database bulk insert methods instead of individual inserts
- **Data validation**: Validate before inserting to avoid partial failures
- **Progress tracking**: Store upload status so users know progress
- **Error handling**: Log failed rows, allow retry mechanism
- **Database optimization**: Disable indexes during bulk insert, re-enable after

**Example approach**: "I'd use a background job queue. When user uploads Excel, I'd store it temporarily, create a job that reads the file in chunks (using libraries like Apache POI or pandas), validates each chunk, and uses bulk insert. I'd track progress in a separate table and notify the user when complete."

## **How to Prepare:**

1. **Practice the STAR method**: Situation, Task, Action, Result
2. **Draw diagrams**: Sketch architecture/flow when explaining
3. **Think out loud**: Interviewers want to see your thought process
4. **Ask clarifying questions**: "How many users?", "What's the expected load?", "Any specific constraints?"
5. **Start simple, then scale**: Begin with basic solution, then optimize
6. **Discuss trade-offs**: Every solution has pros/cons - mention them

Good luck with your interview preparation! ðŸš€
