# Docker Q&A Summary

This document summarizes key Docker concepts and Q&A from our recent discussions.

---

## 1. What does `docker build -t yourusername/your-app-name:tag .` do?

- **Builds a Docker image** from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
- The `-t` flag tags the image with a name and optional tag (e.g., `myuser/myapp:1.0`).
- **Does NOT run** a container. It only creates the image.

---

## 2. Do you need to reference the Dockerfile in your YAML file?

- **No.**  
  If you build the image manually with `docker build`, you do not need to specify the build context in your `docker-compose.yml`.
- If you want Docker Compose to build the image for you, use the `build:` section in your YAML.

---

## 3. What happens if you run `docker build -t ...` twice?

- Docker will **rebuild the image** each time.
- If nothing has changed in your code or Dockerfile, Docker uses its cache and the build is fast.
- If you changed something, it will rebuild the relevant layers.

---

## 4. How to run a container from the built image?

After building, run:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/your-app-name:tag
```

---

## 5. What does `docker-compose.yml` do?

- Defines and manages multi-container Docker applications.
- Example services:
  - **mongo**: MongoDB database container.
  - **mongo-express**: Web UI for MongoDB.
  - **app**: Your custom Express.js app (optional).
- Named volumes (like `mongo_data`) persist data even if containers are removed.
- The `depends_on` field ensures services start in the correct order.

---

## 6. What happens when you run `docker compose up -d` multiple times?

- **Containers**: If already created, they are restarted. If the image or configuration changed, containers are recreated.
- **Volumes**: Named volumes persist and are not recreated unless explicitly removed.
- **Summary Table:**

| Command                        | Action                                      |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose up -d`         | Restarts containers, volumes persist        |
| `docker compose up -d` (after code/image change) | Recreates changed containers, volumes persist |
| `docker compose down -v`       | Removes containers and volumes              |

---

## 7. How to use a published Docker image on another machine?

1. **Pull the image:**
   ```sh
   docker pull yourusername/your-app-name:tag
   ```
2. **Run the container:**
   ```sh
   docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/your-app-name:tag
   ```

---

## 8. How to publish (push) a Docker image to Docker Hub?

1. **Build the image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t yourusername/your-app-name:tag .
   ```
2. **Login to Docker Hub:**
   ```sh
   docker login
   ```
3. **Push the image:**
   ```sh
   docker push yourusername/your-app-name:tag
   ```
4. **Check on Docker Hub:**  
   Visit [Docker Hub Repositories](https://hub.docker.com/repositories) to see your image.

---

## 9. Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server-2.js"]
```

---

## 10. Example docker-compose.yml (with app, mongo, mongo-express)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express:latest
    container_name: mongo-express
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mongo
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT: 27017
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: root
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: example

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: express_app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      MONGO_URI: mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/
    depends_on:
      - mongo

volumes:
  mongo_data:
```

---

**Tip:**  
You can run only MongoDB and Mongo Express by removing the `app` service from your compose file if you want to use your app outside


Let's break down your questions step by step:

#### ===================================================================####

### 1. **What does the Dockerfile do?**

The Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server-2.js"]
```
**creates a Docker image** for your Node.js application. This image contains everything needed to run your app (Node.js, dependencies, your code).

---

### 2. **If you run the container (e.g., via Docker Desktop), can you make HTTP requests and perform all operations?**

**Yes!**  
Once the container is running (and port 3000 is published), you can make HTTP requests to your app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).  
You do **not** need to run the app on your host machine; the container is self-contained.

---

### 3. **Do you need to run the application on the host machine as well?**

**No.**  
If your app is running in a Docker container, you do **not** need to run it on your host machine. The container is your running app.

---

### 4. **What if you make changes to your code and run the old container again?**

- If you **only restart the existing container**, you will **not** see your code changes.  
  The container uses the code that was present when the image was built.
- To see your changes:
  1. **Rebuild the image** (`docker build ...`)
  2. **Restart the container** with the new image.

---

### 5. **Explanation of each Dockerfile line**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
```
- Uses the official Node.js version 18 image as the base.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```
- Sets the working directory inside the container to `/usr/src/app`.

```dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
```
- Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if present) to the container.

```dockerfile
RUN npm install
```
- Installs Node.js dependencies inside the container.

```dockerfile
COPY . .
```
- Copies all your application code into the container.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```
- Informs Docker that the app will listen on port 3000.

```dockerfile
CMD ["node", "server-2.js"]
```
- Sets the default command to run your app using Node.js.

---

**Summary:**  
- Build the image after code changes to update the container.
- You only need to run the app in Docker, not on your host.
- The Dockerfile ensures your app runs the same everywhere.

```

# After running docker compose up -d, where does your app run?
# Your app (app service) runs inside a Docker container, not directly on your host machine.
# You can access it from your host at http://localhost:3000 because of the published port mapping ("3000:3000").
# All dependencies and code run isolated in the container environment.
# You do not need to run your app separately on your host machine.
